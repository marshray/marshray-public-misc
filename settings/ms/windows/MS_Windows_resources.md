## cmd.exe

This form of ancient script has origins pre-dating even the original IBM PC.

[Its various incarnations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_DOS_operating_systems) have been known as:
* CP/M
* 86-DOS
* PC-DOS
* MS-DOS
* DR-DOS
* `.BAT`
* `.CMD`
* Windows NT Command Prompt Interpreter
* The language so bad it doesn't even have a name.

Its syntax is very idiosyncratic.

The only reason to use this language is that it comes built-in with the
Windows OS. It's primary purpose is to set environment variables and
launch other programs.

If you have to tangle with this, the best reference by far is [SS64](https://ss64.com/nt/).
